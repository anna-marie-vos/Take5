This is the index.
Purpose:
When someone goes to a construction site they should do a safety check. (kind of like a "body scan" - but for the workplace)

If you notice any workplace hazards you:

1) go to the webpage and log on,
2) click on the specific site / workplace.
3) Go through the various hazards
3a) search for a specific hazard
4) add a tick to a specific hazard if its already there (to increase the importance)
5) update / add a new comment.
6) it will autolog the user and timestamp
7) it should have a mitigation / eliminate column, to show others how to mitigate / eliminate the risk - propose mitigations here.
8) add a new hazard if it's not already there
9) it should have prompts to help identify hazards
10) it should send / alert the owner of the risk about any new risks
11) the owner should be able to rate the risk priority
12) the creator / contributor of a risk should be notified of any changes to a specific risk.
