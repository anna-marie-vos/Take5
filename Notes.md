Notes of things to resolve:

1) how do I get the project_ID from my edit form?
2) how do I allow the project_ID to be changed in the from even if the number is changed?

--Q2:Posible answer: Add another column called project_num and allow that one to be changed.

3) how to link an empty hazard to a new project so that the other code works
